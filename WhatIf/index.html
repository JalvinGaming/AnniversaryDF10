            <h1>What If?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>One million years we lived in the woods<br>
                The flowers can fill us with hope<br>
                The deers and rabbits and squirrels could<br>
                Give us friends when others said “nope.”
                </p>
            <br>
            <p>But then you had bears and these creatures would roar<br>
                And chase us down exciting us,<br>
                But all of that hope and excitement turned into bore<br>
                Of the cities of train and bus.
                </p>
            <br>
            <p>One night I left home to venture outside<br>
                Encountered a gate, “What’s hiding behind?”<br>
                My brain went haywire, but all hope was lost,<br>
                When all that I saw was grey.
                </p>
            <br>
            <p>All life was gone, the black roads were empty,<br>
                The places for people were gone.<br>
                When I did see a person, they were in a metal box,<br>
                And I wish, oh I wish they were back in the forest.
                </p>
            <br>
            <p>Seeking hope, I returned to the forest,<br>
                But the gate was nowhere to be found.<br>
                I looked around, but no luck, but I know,<br>
                I think we can turn it around.
                </p>
            <br>
            <p>Bring back the flowers, bring back the fauna,<br>
                Seek all the forests and break from the sauna,<br>
                We need some bears, we need some cliffs,<br>
                But all that is just a “What if?”
